# javascript-checkpoint
In this checkpoint i have done some edabit tasks going through different levels of difficulty.
Now talking about the challenges I did:
*How much is true? => we create a function which returns the number of true values there are in an array. It Returns 0 if given an empty array and
all array items are of the type boolean (true or false).(moyen)
*A redundant function=> we write a function redundant that takes in a string str and returns a function that returns str.(moyen)
*Seven Boom!=> we create a function that takes an array of numbers and return "Boom!" if the digit 7 appears in the array. Otherwise, 
return "there is no 7 in the array".(difficile)
*Number of Boomerangs=> we create a function that returns the total number of boomerangs in an array.(difficile)
*Return the Sum of Two Numbers=> Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.(très facile)
*Convert Minutes into Seconds=> we convert minutes by seconds by multiplying the minutes by 60.(très facile)
*Convert Hours into Seconds=> we convert hours by seconds by multiplying the hours by 3600.(très facile)
*Maximum Edge of a Triangle=>we create a function that finds the maximum range of a triangle's third edge, where the side lengths 
are all integers((side1 + side2) - 1 = maximum range of third edge).(très facile)
*Find the Perimeter of a Rectangle=>we return the result (2*(width+length)).(très facile)
*Add up the Numbers from a Single Number=> we create a function that takes a number as an argument. Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function. For example, if the input
is 4 then your function should return 10 because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.(facile)
*Which Function Returns the Larger Number?=> the function will be passed two functions, f and g, that don't take any parameters. My function has to call them, 
and return a string which indicates which function returned the larger number.(facile)
*Largest Swap=> we write a function that takes a two-digit number and determines if it's the largest of two possible digit swaps.(facile)
